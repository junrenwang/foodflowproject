## Discussion

### Comparing the models

We compared the different model results. Among three models we employed, Random Forest showed the best prediction performance. We assume that the good performance of RF is due to (1) RF is good at deal with noise (2)   Also, NN and RF models both shows better prediction performance for larger trade flow.


### Limitations

There are several limitations in this study. 
Firstly, the distance used in this study is haversine distance. 
In other words, we don't consider the transportation route. 
The random forest might underfit,  we try several hyperparameters  under the limitation of long time computing time for Random Forest. 
We donâ€™t consider the commodities trade mode(Domestic, imports or exports) in Random Forest model.
At the same time, different years also have a great impact on transactions, which may be due to the impact of inflation. 
We should add GDP deflator to eliminate this impact.
