## Discussion and Conclusion

### Comparing the models

We compared the different model results. Among three models we employed, Random Forest showed the best prediction performance. We assume that the good performance of RF is due to (1) RF is good at deal with noise (2) RF can capture the nonlinear relationship, Also, NN and RF models both showed better prediction performance for larger trade flow. We thinks that small trade flow might be impacted on more complex variables, which cannot be predicted by the 


### Limitations

There are several limitations in this study. 
Firstly, the distance used in this study is haversine distance. 
In other words, we don't consider the transportation network connected each state. 
Also we didn't adjust the food flow value using GDP deflator to eliminate the impact of inflation. 
We donâ€™t consider the commodities trade mode(Domestic, imports or exports) in Random Forest model.
Meanwhile, we cannot predict zero value weight flow with Neural Network model.
