## Result

### Random Forest
Through GridSearching, the hyperparameters we select is max depth (20) and number of estimators (50).
Figure~\ref shows the estimation results. 
The validation $r^2$ is 0.86. RF model shows the better performance for the large flow.

### Baseline
Using the same data as RF model mentioned above, the validation accuracy $r^2$ of Ridge model is 0.049 because there are so many zeros in the dataset.
