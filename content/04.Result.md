## Result

### Random Forest
Through GridSearching, the hyperparameters we selected was 20 for max depth of tree and 50 for number of independent tree.
Figure @fig:image2 shows the estimation results. 
The validation $r^2$ is 0.86. RF model shows the better performance for the large flow.

Figure @fig:image3 shows the importance of features on this bilateral food flow regression problem.

The red bars are the importance of the forest with inter-trees variability.  
As expected, commodity type, gdp of importors and gdp of exporters are informative. 
Surprisingly, distance and year shows less impact on the regressiom results. 
The performance of the distance variable is inconsistent with the law of the gravity model, and we consider that this may be due to the harversine distance we use.

### Baseline
Using the same data as RF model mentioned above, the validation accuracy $r^2$ of Ridge model is 0.049 because there are so many zeros in the dataset. 
We fitted gravity model to bilateral food flow data with PPML estimator, as shown in Figure @fig:image4.
As we specified the commodity type and transportation mode, there is no group variance.
