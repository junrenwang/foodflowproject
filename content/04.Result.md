## Result

### Random Forest
Through GridSearching, the hyperparameters we selected is 20 for max depth of tree and 50 for number of independent tree.
Figure @fig:image2 shows the estimation results. 
The validation $r^2$ is 0.86. RF model shows the better performance for the large flow.

Figure @fig:image3 shows the importance of features on this bilateral food flow regression problem.

The red bars are the importance of the forest with inter-trees variability.  
As expected, commodity type, gdp of importors and gdp of exporters are informative. 
Surprisingly, distance and year shows less impact on the regressiom results.

### Baseline
Using the same data as RF model mentioned above, the validation accuracy $r^2$ of Ridge model is 0.049 because there are so many zeros in the dataset. 
We fitted gravity model to bilateral food flow data with PPML estimator, as shown in Figure @fig:image4.
As we specified the commodity type and transportation mode, there is no group variance.
